# task4
I loaded the Titanic data and looked at the first few rows. I cleaned the data by removing some columns and filling missing values. I changed text data to numbers using one-hot encoding. Then I split the data into training and test parts. I trained a logistic model and made predictions. At the end, I checked how good the model is using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
